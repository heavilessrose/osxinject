This is an example of DLL-Injection on OS X. It's 
the equivalent to LD_PRELOADing on BSD/Linux.

1. run build.sh
2. run run.sh

If you examine the files you will see that the
testbinary is not linked with "inject.dylib".

We only set the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES env variable
to let dyld preload our library before executing
anything.

If you perform the exports into your terminal
you will see that our injected code is executed
for any binary you run within that terminal session.

This might come handy if you try to inject your code
into a remote process. (Building plugins for applications
that don't support extensions. Or writing a cheat/trainer
for a game.)
